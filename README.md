# AI-Powered-Data-Pattern-Discovery

### Machine Learning-assisted Text Pattern Discovery in the Bible

### Overview

This repository documents an academic paper representing a pivotal milestone within my Master's program at University College Dublin (UCD). The focus of this project is the application of machine learning to uncover intricate patterns within textual data. Through the utilization of advanced AI techniques, the goal is to gain meaningful insights and unveil significant trends from within the text.

### Project Details

### Methodology
The project revolves around the concept of text mining, where a comprehensive analysis of textual data is performed to uncover patterns, relationships, and correlations. The four essential steps of text mining are followed:

Feature Representation: Leveraging the power of unsupervised machine learning, specifically the word2vec algorithm, to represent words within the text as vectors.
Feature Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the feature space, allowing for efficient analysis and pattern extraction.
Pattern Mining: Employing neural networks to mine and discover meaningful patterns within the text data.
Pattern Evaluation: Evaluating and interpreting the identified patterns to derive insights and knowledge.
Text Data
The selected text dataset for this project is the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. The KJV is a significant translation of the Bible, published in 1611, and has played a vital role in English language culture and literature.

Method Selection
The project employs the word2vec method to create word embeddings, allowing for the analysis of semantic relationships between words. This unsupervised machine learning approach captures intricate nuances within the text data and facilitates the identification of patterns.

NLP Sentiment Analysis
An additional dimension of analysis is introduced through Natural Language Processing (NLP) sentiment analysis. By utilizing the VADER lexicon, sentiment intensity is evaluated for each sentence, allowing for the classification of sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

Word2Vec Modeling
The heart of the project lies in the vectorization of words using the word2vec model. This methodology facilitates the exploration of semantic relationships between words and uncovers meaningful connections within the text.

Evaluation and Findings
The findings of the analysis reveal compelling insights into the text dataset. Through visualization and exploration, patterns and trends emerge, shedding light on the semantic structure of the Bible text.
